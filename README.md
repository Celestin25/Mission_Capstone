# Mental Health Assistant App

## Overview
This app leverages a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict heart disease based on medical inputs. It is built using TensorFlow and scikit-learn, employing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network which is optimized and evaluated to ensure high accuracy and performance.

## Model Development and Evaluation

### Features
- **Model Creation**: The MLP model includes multiple dense layers and uses regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Training**: Optimally trained on a dataset with carefully selected hyperparameters for the best performance.
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are provided along with confusion matrix and classification reports.

## Pipeline Creation

### Functions
- Python functions encapsulate all steps of the ML pipeline, ensuring code modularity and reusability.
- **Retraining Mechanism**: A robust and well-documented mechanism for retraining the model with new data is included.

## Submission and Documentation

### GitHub Repository Structure
1. **README.md**: Provides detailed instructions for setting up and running the project.
2. **Model Files**: Includes Jupyter notebooks (`Mentalhealth_Chatbot.ipynb`) and Python scripts (`myapp.py`, `predictions.py`), detailing the model's development and deployment.
## Repo link :

3. **Deployment Files**: Contains all necessary configurations for deploying the model on a cloud platform.
4. **URL**: Link to the deployed app ().

## Deployment

- **Cloud Platform**: The ML pipeline is deployed on a cloud platform, ensuring scalability and easy access. The deployment is consistent with the development in the notebook and pipeline files. In my case I will use streamlit.io/  for deployment my app as one of Cloud Platform that is being used in Machine learning World.

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the necessary packages (`tensorflow`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`) installed.
